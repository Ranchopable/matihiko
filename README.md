# matihiko
My learning library

I have created this repository as a single source of all my learning notes/resources/projects as I begin my coding journey.

Learning how to utilise Github is part of this journey, so I plan to return to edit and update this README as my matihiko repository takes shape.

I look forward to finding out what shape it will take!
